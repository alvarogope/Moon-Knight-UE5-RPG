A solo-developed third-person action RPG built in Unreal Engine 5. All core gameplay systems — combat, enemy AI, animation, inventory, equip, dialogue, target lock, and death — were designed and implemented from scratch using Blueprint Visual Scripting.

## ⚔️ Systems Overview
 
### Combat System
 
The player attacks using a **4-hit light attack combo chain** driven by an `AttackIndex` integer (0–4) routed through a `Switch on Int` node. Each attack plays its own Animation Montage and sets the index to the next value. After the 4th hit the combo finisher triggers automatically.
 
- **Combo continuation** is managed via a `SaveAttack` boolean — if the player inputs during an active attack, the next attack is queued and fires on the combo window
- **Combo reset** sets `IsAttacking` to false and `AttackIndex` back to 0
- **Player can be hit mid-combo** — no invincibility frames during attacks
- **Player can dodge mid-combo** at any point in the chain
 
**Hit detection** uses a looping `Sphere Trace By Channel` (Visibility) running every **0.001s** between `SwordTopPoint` and `SwordBottomPoint` bones on the weapon mesh. Valid targets are filtered by the Actor Tag `"Damageable"`. On a confirmed hit, `ApplyDamage` is called and a particle emitter spawns at the impact location.
 
| | Player | Enemy |
|---|---|---|
| Sphere trace radius | 120 units | 300 units |
| Base damage | 200 | 140 |
| Trace channel | Visibility | Visibility |

---

### Enemy AI — Standard Enemy
 
Driven by a custom **Behaviour Tree** (`BD_AI`) with four states managed via Blackboard keys:
 
```
Patrol → Investigate (on sound) → Chase → Attack
```
 
- **Patrol** — moves to random points within a **3000 unit** radius, waits **2 seconds** at each point
- **Investigate** — on detecting the player via hearing, moves to the last known location and waits **9 seconds** before resuming patrol
- **Chase** — `BT_Task_ChaseTarget` moves toward `TargetActor`, stops at **100 units**
- **Attack** — triggers when within **250 units** of the target via `BT_Task_AttackTarget`
 
A `BT_Service_GetDistanceToTarget` service ticks every **0.40–0.60 seconds** to update the `inMeleeAttackRange` Blackboard key, gating the transition from chase to attack.
 
Detection is handled by a dedicated AI Detection Blueprint using UE5's **Perception System** (sight stimulus). On detection, the target actor is written to the Blackboard. On losing sight, the Blackboard key is cleared.

---

### Enemy AI — Mini-Boss (Werewolf)
 
A distinct enemy type with a simpler but more aggressive Behaviour Tree (`BD_Werewolf`):
 
```
Patrol ↔ Combat (Chase + Attack simultaneously)
```
 
- No investigation state — once the player is spotted (`seeingTarget? Is Set`), the boss immediately enters combat
- Uses a `Simple Parallel` node to **chase and attack at the same time**, unlike the standard enemy which does one or the other
- Has a **dedicated health bar widget** (`WB_Werewolf_H`) that appears on aggro and tracks `Health / 350.0` via `SetPercent` on Event Tick
- `BT_Task_BossChaseTarget` and `BT_Task_BossAttacks` are custom tasks separate from the standard enemy's
 
| | Standard Enemy | Mini-Boss |
|---|---|---|
| Max health | 200 | 350 |
| Investigation | Yes (9s) | No |
| Chase + Attack | Sequential | Simultaneous (Simple Parallel) |
| Health bar | Shared HUD | Dedicated widget |

---

### Target Lock System
 
Triggered by `IA_TargetLock` input. Fires a **Sphere Trace For Objects** (**radius 200, range 1500 units**) from the camera forward vector, filtering for `PhysicsBody` and `Pawn` object types. The hit actor is validated against the `"Damageable"` tag before being stored as the lock target. Triggering again when a target is already locked clears the reference (toggle).

---

### Inventory & Equip System
 
Slot-based inventory backed by a **Data Table** using custom `S_Slots` and `S_Items` structs. Each item row stores: Name, Damage, Icon, StaticMesh, Type, and WeaponSocket.
 
Equipping a weapon calls `Get Data Table Row` → `Break S_Items` → `Set Static Mesh` on the appropriate character socket. Supports two equip slots: **Sword** and **Bow**.

---

### Pickup System
 
On `IA_Interact` input, a **Sphere Trace For Objects** (radius **7 units**, range **1000 units**) fires from the camera forward vector into `WorldDynamic` objects. On hit, the actor is cast to `BP_Weapon`, added to inventory via `AddWeapon`, and destroyed from the world.

---

### Death & Respawn
 
On the `Die` event:
1. Player input is disabled
2. Mesh physics simulation is enabled (ragdoll)
3. Camera fades from **0 → 1** over **5 seconds**
4. After a **4.9 second** delay, the current level is reloaded via `Open Level (by Name)`

### HUD / UI
 
| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| Player health bar | Driven by `CurrentHealth / MaxHealth` via `SetPercent` |
| Enemy health bar | Shared across standard enemies and player via character type selector |
| Mini-Boss health bar | Dedicated widget (`WB_Werewolf_H`), activated on aggro |
| Inventory screen | Slot-based UMG widget |
| Dialogue box | Linear NPC conversations with speaker name display |
